As a passionate mountaineer and climber I have begun to study atmospheric sciences to have a better understanding why weather forecasting can be challenging, and also to create my own (and precise) weather forecasts :) . Immediately, the deeper insight into science has led to so many interesting fields where I have wanted to know more about. 

Currently, I am doing my PhD in atmospheric sciences at the [University of Innsbruck, Austria][acinn].
