A new 'fun'-project just occured. A friend became a maintainer of a weather station of the hydrographic service of Carinthia, and he remembered that there is this one collegue who is working on weather forecasts. Consequently, a new goal came up for me, which is to create his own forecasts for this specific location.

So I got confronted with mainly 2 issues:  
- he has no access to the actual observations,  
- he also has no information from numerical weather prediction models.

This means that I have nothing I can work with. But luckily, there is a website where all the current observations of temperature and precipitation amounts are published in a 15 minute interval (raw data). Hence, it was the first step to get this data automatically and to create a ("long-term") record of temperature data.  
This is now done by a short R-script which accesses the content of the html-table of the page. Additionally, a cron-job starts this script automatically every 15 minutes, and saves the data locally. The result is a nice rda-file which will be the basis for future forecast steps:

</p>

This whole project is running under **homecast** and available on github: 

> **homecast** (homemade meteorological forecast) -> [github repository][repository]{:target="_blank"}

Currently, only the automatic dowloader of the html content published by the hydrographic service is running.  
Future steps include attempts to make predicitons with different statistical forecast approaches. This also involves data from freely available numerical weather prediciton model (e.g., GFS) or other data sources (e.g., soundings).
