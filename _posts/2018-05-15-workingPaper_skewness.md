There is a new working paper online which deals with probabilistic temperature post-processing of ensemble forecasts in Alpine regions with a skwewed response distribution. This article defines the last part of my PhD work and is getting reviewed at [ASCMO][ASCMO]{:target="_blank"}, but the working paper is already [online][WP_2018]{:target="_blank"}.  

In this work, we present a nice and simple approach which improves the probabilistic forecast skill significantly at Alpine regions, but also with minor improvements at plain and foreland environments.
