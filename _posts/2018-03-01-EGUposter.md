There will be a [poster][link]{:target="_blank"} at EGU about the results of the Masterthesis of one of my students (Peter Graber) who used non-homogeneous regression for post-processing ensemble forecasts regarding artificial snow making conditions for skiing resorts in Northern Italy.  
If you are there and have some time you should take a look and we can have a discussion about this topic or the approach used. The poster session will be in hall X4.375 on **Wednesday, 11 Apr at 17:30â€“19:00**. Hope to see you there!
