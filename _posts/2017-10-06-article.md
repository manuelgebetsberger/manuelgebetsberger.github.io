Finally, my first scientific journal article (Gebetsberger et al. 2017) is in press and already available as an EOR (early online release) at Monthly Weather Review. It is about probabilistic precipitation forecasting in a mountainous region in the European Alps. In this study, we propose three statistical refinements for an existing and frequently used post-processing technique (non-homogeneous Gaussian regression, NGR), which statistically corrects for errors in numerical weather prediction models.  
The refinements could improve the predictive performance particularly on 3h accumulation periods, showing benefits on full probabilistic forecasting, and on exceedance for two particular thresholds (probability of precipitation and probability of "extreme" precipitation amounts).  
The PDF of the manuscript is currently available only for subscribers, but after proof-reading the article will be freely available!
